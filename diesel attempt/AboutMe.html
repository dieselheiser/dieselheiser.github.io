											<h2>Orion Heiser</h2>
											<p>What about me?</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											In the shadowed folds of the Earth where sunlight barely kissed the land, a small colony of gnomes thrived in the crags of an ancient mountain. Among them was a peculiar boy named Orion, who, though raised by the gnomes, was clearly different. He was taller, his limbs sturdier, and his hands larger—hands not meant for burrowing or chiseling stone but for something softer, more yielding.

The gnomes often whispered among themselves.
“Where did he come from?” one muttered.
“No child of the Earthborn should be so… human-like,” another hissed.
But the elder gnome, wise and ancient, silenced them. “Orion is ours now. Treat him as such.”

As Orion grew, he discovered a strange fascination with clay. The gnomes, adept at carving and sculpting gems, scoffed at his interest in the soft, unrefined earth.
“Why waste time with mud?” growled Old Garven, the taskmaster.
“It listens to me,” Orion would reply, his hands coated in the slick embrace of wet clay. “Stone is proud and stubborn, but clay… it changes with a whisper.”

One fateful day, after years of shaping crude bowls and misshapen figures in secret, Orion approached the elder gnome with his creations.
“These are my works,” he said, placing a small, uneven vase on the stone table. “I want to master this craft, but I need guidance.”
The elder gnome examined the vase, turning it in his gnarled hands. “Your hands speak to the clay, but your heart must speak louder. Go to the surface, boy. Seek the potter’s wheel and the kiln. Your answers lie there.”

											<h3>The Jounrey Above</h3>

										<p>
											Orion bid farewell to the gnomes who had raised him and journeyed to the surface world. It was a harsh awakening. The sun burned his skin, and the winds chapped his face. People laughed at his oversized hands and gnome-forged clothing.

One day, hungry and desperate, he stumbled into a potter’s village. The scent of fired clay and glaze filled the air, and Orion’s heart leapt. He approached a potter at his wheel, an old man named Alaric.
“Please, master potter,” Orion begged. “Teach me your art.”
Alaric raised a skeptical brow. “Why would I teach a ragged wanderer with nothing to offer?”
Orion hesitated before holding out his hands. “I have these. Strong hands that listen to clay. And I’ll work harder than anyone you’ve ever met.”

Alaric studied him for a long moment before nodding. “Fine. But know this—pottery is as much about patience as it is strength. Are you ready to fail a thousand times?”

“I’ve already failed a thousand times,” Orion replied. “What’s a thousand more?”

												<h3>The Master Potter</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Under Alaric’s stern tutelage, Orion learned the nuances of spinning clay, the timing of the kiln, and the delicate balance of glazes. His failures were many, and his first pots crumbled or cracked. Each time, he heard Alaric’s gruff voice:
“Again, boy! The clay won’t wait for your pity.”

Years passed, and Orion’s skill grew. His pots began to tell stories—the curves of a bowl spoke of mountain winds, and the glazes shimmered like the hidden gems of the gnome caverns. Soon, his works drew the admiration of villagers and nobles alike.

One day, as Orion unveiled his latest creation—a vase so delicate it seemed to float—Alaric approached him with a rare smile. “You’ve surpassed me, boy. Your hands were made for this.”

Orion looked at his mentor, his heart swelling with gratitude. “And you, master, gave me the wheel to make it possible.”

												<h3>The Legacy</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In time, Orion became a legend. His pottery graced the halls of kings and the hearths of common folk. Yet he never forgot the gnomes who had raised him, nor the elder who had sent him on his path. In the heart of every pot, he left a small mark: a spiral, the symbol of his journey from the depths of the Earth to the mastery of his craft.

And so, Orion’s name was etched not in stone, but in the clay that told his story, a tale of patience, resilience, and hands that whispered to the earth.
